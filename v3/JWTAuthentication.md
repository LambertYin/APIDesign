## The Basics

Comm100 RESTful API must use **https** protocol. What the API requests should start with depends on your platform domain, which can be accessed from both your Control Panel and web version Agent Console after successful login. For example:

- If the domain of your Control Panel is portal1.comm100.io, all API requests should start with https://api1.comm100.com/api/v3/.

### Global, Livechat & Report API JWT Authentication

  You can only use jwt authenticate to exchange an agent's email„ÄÅpassword and siteId for an jwt token directly while calling the global, livechat or report API. This grant type is highly secured by Comm100.

##### Using curl

  Params:

- loginType - specify `password` as the value.
- userName - the email of the agent account.
- password - the password of the agent account.
- siteId - the site which the agent belongs to.

```bash
    curl https://x.comm100.com/adminwebservice/api/jwttoken/generate -H "Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded"  
     -d 'loginType=password&userName={comm100_agent_email}&password={comm100_agent_password}&siteId={siteId}'  
     -x POST
```

## Error Handling

Errors are returned using standard HTTP error code syntax. Generally, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success; codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error (bad or missing parameters, not authenticated, etc.); codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Comm100 Live Chat servers.

- `400` - Bad Request. The request cannot be fulfilled due to bad syntax. You need to make sure that passed arguments are matching format in the method's documentation.
- `401` - Unauthorized. The username or API key you provide is invalid. Please make sure that you authenticate with the correct username or API key.
- `403` - Forbidden. Your permission to access the requested resource has been denied or the number of your API requests has exceeded the limit of the day.
- `404` - Not Found. The requested resource could not be found but may be available at a later time.
- `500` - Internal Server Error. The request was incorrect. You need to make sure that the passed arguments match the formats in the method's documentation.

An error including `code` and `message` is returned in JSON format when an API request fails. For example:

```bash
{ code: 400000, message: "Parameter 'timeFrom' is required." }
```
